// src/enhanced/index.ts — area barrel: imports this area's converted modules in
// their required execution order. Owned by the enhanced conversion wave; main.ts
// imports this barrel once, so conversions never edit main.ts itself.
//
// Order mirrors the former enhanced/ section of allComponentScripts in
// js/plugin.js — modules must keep their relative execution order as they
// convert, because later legacy files still assume everything above them ran.
